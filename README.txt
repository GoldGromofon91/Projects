							Hello!
This repository contains different projects and tasks (of varying complexity) written in Python, that I found in books or came up with myself.

======================================================================================================================================
1. First Tasks (Adress_Book):
Create your own “Address Book” program that works from a command line (or from the IDE)  and allows you to view, add, modify, delete, or search for contact details of your friends. In addition, this information should also be stored on disk for later access. 
from book: A byte of Python ver. 2. 01 (http://www.swaroopch.com/about/)

2. Calculate with using Python kivy framework:
My first computer calculator application

3. My first Django project (without UI/UX) --> Notes
